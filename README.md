## Code for "Integrating single index effects in Generalized Additive Models"
Here we provide the code and data for reproducing the results in Collarin and Fasiolo (2024). In particular:

 - gefCom2014.RData contains the data set on Gefcom2014 data and temperatures from 25 different weather stations;
 - IWSM2024_GefCom_application.R contains the code for fitting the two GAM models considered in the paper and for producing the plots shown in the paper.
